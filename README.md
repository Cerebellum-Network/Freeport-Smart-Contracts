Commit e1852250 on Polygon
Mumbai: [0x656E87eC4607E81896C41de2135db72ee8abce13](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x656E87eC4607E81896C41de2135db72ee8abce13)

### 2021-07-23: Integration with meta-transactions, marketplaces, and royalties bypass

- Add access control mechanism to support other features in a flexible way.

- Introduce a meta-transactions forwarder contract and deployment.
  See [MinimalForwarder](contracts/MinimalForwarder.sol)
  and the [deploy script](migrations/2_deploy_forwarder.js).

- Support meta-transactions using the standard ERC2771. See the role `META_TX_FORWARDER`
  in [MetaTxContext](contracts/freeportParts/MetaTxContext.sol)

- Add a mechanism to bypass royalties. There can be a meta-transaction forwarder whose transactions are not subject to
  royalties. See the role `BYPASS_SENDER` in [TransferFees](contracts/freeportParts/TransferFees.sol), used
  for [BypassForwarder](contracts/BypassForwarder.sol).

- Support marketplaces in a generic way. The smart contracts from marketplaces can be connected by giving them
  permissions to make transfers. See the role `TRANSFER_OPERATOR` in `TransferOperator.sol`

### 2021-07-14: ERC20 bridge

- Add support for
  [Polygon Bridge](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/ethereum-matic/pos/mapping-assets/#custom-child-token)
  with the `deposit` and `withdraw` functions.
- Make the contract verifiable on Polyscan (solidity version, dependencies, flattening).

Commit 021f0116 on Polygon Mumbai
[0x509Dfd7c670AC89246723EFe0f80f433BfbB6E5c](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x509Dfd7c670AC89246723EFe0f80f433BfbB6E5c)

## How to deploy

    npm test
    npm run migrate --network=polygon_testnet

Write down the contract address and current version in the Releases section above.

Commit these files in `build/contracts/`: `Freeport.json`, `MinimalForwarder.json`, `BypassForwarder.json`
, `FiatGateway.json`.

For **dev** on Polygon testnet, setup test accounts:

    truffle exec scripts/dev_setup.js --network=polygon_testnet

For **staging** on Polygon testnet, setup test accounts:

    truffle exec scripts/stage_setup.js --network=polygon_testnet

The script will print the address of the different accounts, including the fiat-to-nft service account.

(optional) For tests or staging on Polygon testnet, setup the Polygon bridge:

    truffle exec scripts/dev_bridge.js --network=polygon_testnet

Verify on Polyscan using the information in Freeport.json and the flattened code:

    npm run flatten

More instructions can be found in the original [README of the template](BUILD.md).

## How to use test image

### 1. To copy the latest snapshot of db with deployed contract and built contracts use

`sudo . ./copy-artifacts.sh dir_path_to (copy to your directory)`\
`sudo . ./copy-artifacts.sh (copy to default ./artifacts directory)`

### 2. To run ganache cli locally with already deployed contract use

`export MNEMONIC='spatial spin account funny glue cancel cushion twelve inmate author night dust'`\
`export NETWORK_ID=5777`\
`docker run -d -p 8545:8545 338287888375.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/crb-davinci-nft-test:latest --db /app/db --mnemonic $MNEMONIC --networkId $NETWORK_ID`

## How to update Freeport SDK 

1. Open [SDK](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/Freeport-Smart-Contracts-SDK) project in IDE, switch to master branch
2. Copy smart-contract artifacts from `/build/contracts` to SDK's `/src/artifacts`
3. Run `yarn update-types`
4. Commit changes with message like *"artifacts from commit e57691bc"*
5. Check that `npm whoami` returns "cere-io" (otherwise update your NPM_TOKEN env var for publishing @cere packages)
6. Run `yarn deploy` and publish next version (see [Versioning](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/Freeport-Smart-Contracts-SDK#versioning))
7. Push changes to the remote branch
8. Install the new version of SDK in projects that use it

## How to run e2e test locally
Readme.md for running e2e-test locally is [here](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/e2e-tests/blob/master/README.md#how-to-run-e2e-tests-locally).
For this service you need to create image locally and tag it with tag `338287888375.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/crb-davinci-nft-test:YOUR_CUSTOM_TAG`
and use `YOUR_CUSTOM_TAG` for running e2e-tests locally.

## Where to check the e2e-tests result after merge in dev?
After merge in develop, make sure that tests passed in **@e2e-test-results** channel on Cere Slack.
