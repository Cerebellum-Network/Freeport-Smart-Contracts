/**
An auction is characterized by a sequence of transactions and their corresponding events:

- `StartAuction`: A seller offers to sell one NFT to the highest bidder, with a minimum price, and a closing time.

- Any number of `BidOnAuction`: A potential buyer accepts the minimum price or a price at least 10% higher
than that of the previous bidder.
The closing time may be extended.
A deposit is taken from the new bidder. The deposit of the previous bidder is returned, if any.
Bidding is no longer possible after the closing time.

- `SettleAuction`: The sale is completed between the seller and the highest bidder, or cancelled if there was no bidder.
Some royalties may be taken from the sale price, as configured by the NFT creator (see `TransferFees.sol`).
The settlement is only possible after the closing time.

While an auction is active, it is identified by the tuple `(seller address, NFT ID)`.
However, after the auction is settled, a new auction with the *same tuple* may start.

This contract is not meant to be used from another contract; if it is,
it will not call onERC1155Received hooks for security reasons.

This contract must have the TRANSFER_OPERATOR role in the Freeport contract.
