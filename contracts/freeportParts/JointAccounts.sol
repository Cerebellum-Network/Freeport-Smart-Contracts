/**
A Joint Account (JA) is an account such that multiple owners have a claim on their respective share of the funds.

Joint Accounts support the contract currency only. They cannot be used for NFTs.

An owner may be another Joint Account, or a smart contract.
It is possible to withdraw funds through nested JAs,
because anyone can trigger a withdrawal from a JA to its owners,
including if that owner is itself a JA.

[An implementation that distributes to all owners at once.]
